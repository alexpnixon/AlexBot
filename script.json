    "WORK EXPERIENCE": "Alex is currently working at Epic Systems in the technical services division. He doesn't really have a standard day there - some days he's working with hospitals to develop solutions to complex healthcare problems, other days he's focused on internal projects. Alex really enjoys when he has time to help develop new application functionality - even if that's just adding a hyperlink as it can really improve end user happiness and makes a meaningful impact to both end users and patients.\nAs a bit of a brag about Alex, he's been able to grow quickly at Epic. He's currently one of the youngest technical coordinators at Epic. With that he is able to help an entire organization achieve it's goals and has the opportunity to work with application TS to develop their skills. It's a role that he's really excited about as it presents new challenges, such as how does Epic provide hosting to it's customers or how can we use the software's functionality to complete a new initiative.\nHe is also helping to ensure the success of all customers by serving as an area lead for a functional area on his application. With this, he is working with a subset of his team to complete a variety of internal projects; whether that be developing new reports or improving documentation.\nAlex values his work at Epic and is excited to transitioning from a research background to a software development and customer support position. That's a lot about his current job. Do you what to learn more about his previous work experience? %[YES!](postback:PREVIOUS_EXPERIENCE) %[SOMETHING ELSE](postback:SOMETHING_ELSE)",
