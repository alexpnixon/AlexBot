At the time, he was working on developing a porous microparticle for biodefense applications. His work was funded by a research grant from the University that he was awarded.\nHe then moved to the Center for Applied Proteomics and Molecular Medicine on developing a skin patch to detect skin cancers. During this time he also had the opportunity to mentor a high school student on the project.\nHe then moved back to the Laboratory of Nanotechnology into a paid position where he worked on a nano-herbacide project and a cancer theranostic project.\nHe left that position to finish work on his senior design project, the development of a portable, lightweight and low-cost sit to stand assistive device. His senior design group was selected to give the keynote presentation at the annual Volgenau School of Engineering poster fair.\n %[SOMETHING ELSE](postback:SOMETHING_ELSE)",
